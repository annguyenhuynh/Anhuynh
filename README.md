- 👋 Hi, I'm a GMU undergraduate trying to transition into data analytics industry.
- 🌱 I learned data analytics from Coursera, and other free and affordable resources such as YouTube, Udemy and DataCamp
- I'm sharpening my skills using MS Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to have a chance to apply what I've learned in real life
- 📫 Feel free to email me @ huynhleanh.270897@gmail.com.
