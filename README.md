- 👋 Hi, I'm a GMU undergraduate transitioning into data analytics industry.
- 🌱 I started my journey with Excel, then SQL and data viz tools such as Tableau and Power BI
- I'm also minoring in Business Analytics expecting to learn more about business forecasting and statistics. So far, I've familiarized myself with R, SAS, and Minitab. In the near future, I'll gain formal training in Python and learn advanced statistics.
- 💞️ I'm looking for a chance to apply what I've learned in real-life business situations.
- 📫 Feel free to email me @ hnpa1997@gmail.com
