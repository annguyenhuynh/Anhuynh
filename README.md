- :mortar_board: Hi, I'm an aspiring data analyst graduating from George Mason University class of 2023. 
- :bulb: I started my data analyst journey in my junior year. I started with Structured Query Language (SQL), sharpening the SQL scipting by completeing projects. Visit @annguyenhuynh/SQL or @annguyenhuynh/SQL_8weekchallenge to explore different projects I've completed. These are not the only projects I've done. I had other projets that I haven't uploaded yet and still working on them. 
- :books: I have built a strong foundation in statistics thanks to extensive stats courses of the business analytics minor at GMU. In addition to basic descriptive stats concepts, I'm able to build and test different statistical models in R and Excel in order to select the best model for business forecasting. 
- :computer: Python is the third tool I collected for my data analysis toolkit. With the availability of packages and libraries, Python comes in handy for large data cleansing, transforming, and exploratory data analysis. Python is also a great tool to analyze time series data and machine learning. To learn more about my Python projects, visit @annguyenhuynh/Python_project. My Python projects mainly focus on compreshensive data analysis. Again, there are many projects I'm still working on, especially those related to machine learnng.
- ðŸ“Š: I can communicate the analysis results to tech and non-tech people alike by building dashboards in Excel or Tableau using graphs and charts that are easy to read and understand. In addition to graphing capability in Power BI, I'm also able to transform data using Power Query, and basic DAX language for data aggregations.
- :memo: Along the way, I master Excel skills to make spreadsheets look more neatly, sort and filter data more effectively, extract data using IFs and If-related methods, different types of Lookups, summarize and analyze data with pivot tables and pivot charts, and automate repitive steps with VBA and macros.
- ðŸ“§: Feel free to email me hnpa1007@gmail.com
- Last, I'd love to connect with people and learn from data experts, please connect with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/an-huynh-064a9a14a/
